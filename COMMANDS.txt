# Command lines for building CSS Orientation Test
#
# Version 2015-04-04
#
# The following AFDKO "makeotf" command line builds the OpenType/CFF
# fonts in their respective directories:

makeotf -f cidfont.ps -ff features -fi cidfontinfo -mf FontMenuNameDB -r -ch ../UnicodeAll-UTF32-H -stubCmap4

# Note that the "-stubCmap4" command-line option was just added to the
# "makeotf" tool, and will be available in the next release of AFDKO.

# To add the "stub" 'DSIG' table to the OpenType/CFF font, the
# following AFDKO command line is used:

sfntedit -a DSIG=../DSIG.bin CSSFWOrientationTest.otf
sfntedit -a DSIG=../DSIG.bin CSSHWOrientationTest.otf

# EOF
